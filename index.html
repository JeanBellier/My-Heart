Today it’s 1st January 2026, my name is Jean BELLIER.
You may ask me why I am writing this. I don’t even know myself.
I just feel broken.

My first day of 2026 was maybe the worst I ever had.

I’m going to make a little context if you read this.

When I was in CM2, I played Roblox and met a girl so incredible that even Disney princesses were jealous of her.
She was a pure beauty, physically and mentally.
I loved her and could do anything for her, ANYTHING.
We were happy together, I’m not joking, maybe the happiest couple in the world.

A year passed, or maybe more, and she decided to leave me because of her parents.
I was so affected, and because I didn’t want to lose this diamond, the sunshine of my life,
I tried my best to have her back.
She saw I really loved her and decided to get back with me.
I was literally the happiest man on Earth at this moment.

A year passed again and she decided to leave me because she found another boy.
She told me he was better in everything than what I was.
I was destroyed and cried a lot.
I still tried to stay in contact with her because I loved her
and wished to get back with her.

After all the time spent and all I had done for her, she came back to me.

Even with this, my love for her didn’t become less strong,
but it’s after this that problems came up.
From a girl full of love and happiness,
always cheering me up and loving me,
she changed.
She became depressive.

Of course my love didn’t change.
I still loved her so much.
Helping her and cheering her up even more
wasn’t a problem for me.

My main goal was to make her come back like before,
like if I was a doctor helping his patient.

A year passed again and she broke up with me
because of her mom who didn’t accept me.

I was broken.
My heart started showing marks of break,
but I still did my best to get her back.

After a few weeks, she came back,
but my love for her sadly changed a bit
because of how she was treating me.

I thought it was a game for her to break up.

But still, we loved each other and were happy.

Until it was my turn to say stop.

I was jealous and overprotective.
I couldn’t let her have a boy as a friend.
We broke up because of me this time.

After that, I spoke to her friend.
He told me they were in a relationship
and that my ex was a bitch.

I didn’t understand.
I texted her.
She said she left him.

I felt so good.

We got back together.

Time passed.
She told me she had a guy best friend.
I didn’t trust him.
I asked her to leave him.
She didn’t.

Then her birthday arrived.
I even made a Roblox map for her.
She loved it.

She told me she was doing a party at her house.
A boy was coming to the sleepover.

Later she told me that this boy
would sleep in the same bed as her.

I begged her to make him sleep on the couch.
She didn’t.

I closed my eyes and let it pass
because I didn’t want to lose her again.

Time passed.
We broke up again.

I tried to come back when I saw on her story:
“I loved him so bad.”

We went back together.
I swore I wouldn’t leave her again.

But school came back,
and everything came back to my head:
the cheating,
the boy “better than me”,
the sleepover.

Add to this the stress,
my parents forcing me to work,
my grandfather’s death,
one of my pets dying,
her lies,
her depression,
self-harm,
and a crash video I couldn’t believe.

All of this broke me.

I took distance.
I left her.
I didn’t tell her the real reason.

Now we are here.

A simple Snapchat notification destroyed me again.

It’s always me who comes back.
Never her.

I’m in my bed at Preignan,
writing this in the dark
while my parents sleep,
tears in my eyes.

I don’t hate her.
I never did.

When I’m with her,
every other woman disappears.
She is the light that blinds me
more than every star in the sky.

My love was real.
My pain was real.

If you read this, thank you.
I needed to let it out.

All this text because of a notification…
Isn’t it crazy how a heart can react?
